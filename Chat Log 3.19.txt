Ok so the pecking order for CSS                              \
yeah yeah yeah, but implementation... does it loook like this \

Parent
	Child
		Grandchild
			great grandchild 
			
so we want to think about how our HTML is structured 


so all of your content is wrapped around the body tag
I think that's what I want to do.

body {
	anything you set in here, all of your elements would inherit, unless...
	I specify otherwise in a child element? i.e. 

}

body{
	rule 1;
}
nav{
	or new rule 1,
	etc...
}

but here is where it gets interesting..you have many of the same ELEMENTS ie Sections

section{
	width: 100pxx
	This makes all the sections a particular size..blah blah;
}

but what if you want to target just one section? 
you can either choose its class with .xyz
yeah like that.

SO what is the purpse of [[[Don't use it then]]]?
"body > nav"{
	so this would be for specificity. it's like the old way to target things
	people usually name each class these days.
	look at line 42 in your html
	what if you wanted to set section image to a certain size?
}

you would then use
this is because it is more general. 

section img {

}
give it a shot, see what happens ^^^


I think I get it. I misunderstood the current relevence of using the technique 

don't you mean section.img{
hmmm... i forget if its a space or a . 
try both

}
to modify what though? 

try doing width: 20vh Can you move over to ther services.htm? My index is already pixel perfect, 
and I don't want to mess it up.

yeah no problem
do you want to make a second CSS file for the services.html?
